This project was to help show our knowledge of CRUD with REACT.  It was a lot more challenging than most other projects but also in a way much easier.  We had a good base and reference for getting this done. 

Features:

NavBar to switch between Teams and Players as well as the ability to hit a button to add a new Player or Team.
